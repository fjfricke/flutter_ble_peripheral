# flutter_ble_peripheral

This Flutter plugin allows a device to be used in Peripheral mode. It can be used to advertise to central devices and send data to them as well to subscribe to data from them.

This plugin is loosely based on [flutter_ble_peripheral](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_ble_peripheral.git).

## Help develop this plugin!

At the moment, only iOS devices are supported as I do not have an Android device to test on. If you have an Android device and would like to help develop this plugin, feel free to add pull requests.

## Usage

Please refer to the example app for how to use this plugin.
